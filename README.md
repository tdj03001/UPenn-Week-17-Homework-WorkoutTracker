# WorkoutTracker

# Purpose

Users want to be able to keep track of their workout history with the ability to add specific data points about the forms of exercises they completed. Fitness Tracker is here to provide simple platform for athletes of all progressions to keep a log of their activities.

# Usage

Users will create a new workout by clicking the New Workout button on the home page. Next they will select an exercise type (resistance or cardio) and they will be presented with a list of data points they can fill in. If there was just one exercise to be logged for that workout, users will click the Complete button and the data will be saved to the database for future review/analysis. If there is more than one exercise to be logged, users will click the Add Exercise button to add each exercise for that workout.  

Users can also click the Dashboard button to see graphs and charts summarizing their past workouts.
